VASIC Data Acquisition is a graphic user interface (GUI) designed for 
controlling a VASIC device and was built using the Qt framework. Please note 
that an appropriate VASIC Arduino script must be uploaded to the VASIC device's
Arduino microcontroller in order to enable proper communication between this 
GUI and the VASIC device.
